# Shortest_Path
In this project, I built a Python-based Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) city-tour optimizer that takes a CSV file containing city names along with their latitude and longitude coordinates as input and outputs an optimized route visiting all the cities. The core of the solution is calculating the geodesic distances between the cities using the Haversine formula, which accurately measures distances on the Earth's surface. We first read the CSV file and store the data as Place objects for easy handling. Using the distance matrix computed from these places, we implement a greedy TSP solver that starts at a user-selected city and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited city to form an initial route. To improve this initial route, we apply the 2-opt heuristic, which iteratively swaps pairs of edges to reduce the total travel distance until no further improvement is possible. The program includes a command-line interface allowing users to specify the input CSV, starting city, and whether the route should return to the start city. The final optimized route is printed with the city order and total distance traveled. Additionally, the route is exported as a GeoJSON file, a widely used geospatial data format compatible with mapping tools like Google Maps and geojson.io, enabling easy visualization of the route on a real map. We tested the program with a list of famous Indian cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, demonstrating efficient and practical route optimization. The project emphasizes modular code organization by separating distance calculations, TSP solving heuristics, and input/output handling into reusable Python modules, making the solution extensible and maintainable. This approach not only provides a practical tool for city-tour optimization but also offers an educational experience in working with geographic data, heuristic algorithms, and standard geospatial file formats.
